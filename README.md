# Project Mongo API

In this week's project I got to try out working with MongoDB and Mongoose. I picked a database to store and retrieve data from and used that data to produce a RESTful API. 
I used Mongoose models to model my data and persist my data in the database. 

## The problem

I had a hard time with the server crashing all the time until I got help from a team mate and chat gpt to solve the issue. It turned out I had forgot a "/" in one of my routes and then I needed to reset my server with "RESET_DBV npm run dev". 

I have used express-list-endpoints to display all possible endpoints and routes on the "/" route. I also added a search query for a specific title in the netflix-titles route.
